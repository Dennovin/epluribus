epluribus (a.k.a. the "We the Builders Platform")
==================================================

This is the source code for the crowdsourced 3D printing website at
www.wethebuilders.com.

epluribus is a Rails 4 app that was built at a hackathon and then in
several random hacking sessions thereafter in order to support the
specific projects on the We the Builders site. As such, it is pretty
rough around the edges and contains much which is hard-coded or otherwise
nasty.

Unfortunately, have no instructions for how to bootstrap your
own site installation, nor do we have the resources to offer any support
at this time.

epluribus was originally developed at the 2014 ArtBytes Hackathon at
the [Walters Art Museum](http://thewalters.org/default.aspx) in
Baltimore, MD.

Our team is:

* Matthew Griffin (concept, writing)

Deployment
==========

You'll need:

* Rails 4
* A PostgreSQL database
* Amazon AWS credentials for S3
* Google App Engine credentials for Sign-in with Google
* SMTP configuration for sending emails (we use mandrillapp.com)

We deployed to Heroku's free tier with no problems thus far. Our config vars look like:

    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID:            ...
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY:        ...
    DATABASE_URL:                 (generated by heroku)
    GOOGLE_KEY:                   ...
    GOOGLE_SECRET:                ...
    HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_YELLOW_URL: (generated by heroku)
    S3_BUCKET_NAME:               ...
    SMTP_ALERT_DESTINATION:       some_email@some.domain
    SMTP_HOST:                    ...
    SMTP_PASSWORD:                ...
    SMTP_PORT:                    ...
    SMTP_USERNAME:                ...
    HASHID_SALT:                  ...
